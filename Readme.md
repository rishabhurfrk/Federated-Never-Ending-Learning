# Project Title

**Federated Never-Ending Learning**

## Overview

This project implements a federated learning approach to continuous learning from distributed datasets. The goal is to enable a model to learn from data stored across multiple locations without the need to centralize the data.

## Features

- Federated learning framework
- Continuous learning capabilities
- Privacy-preserving data handling
- Scalability across multiple nodes
